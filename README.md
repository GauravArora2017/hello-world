# hello-world
Learning about Git Hub from Git Hub Education

Hola everyone!
I am Gaurav Arora studying in Atma Ram Santan Dharma College, University Of Delhi(going to pass out in upcoming June) and trying to learn how to learn from each and every person around me and how to implement that learning for the controlled and sustinable growth for each and every citizen of the mother earth.
Coming over my technical background or you can say technical part, I am not a very good coder or programmer like the most of the people on GitHub but I like to code and my favourite language is Python. I love to explore new domains of technology. Right now, I am focusing over Machine Learning(ML).
Now coming over my carrer or my future, I want to pursue civil services and want to serve the citizens of India and especially the children. I believe technology can bring big changes to the society apart from serving only to the big corporates and the programmmers like we all. But at the same time, I also want to work with start-ups on advance technology.
This is short description about myself.
